# Application Launcher program

This is a simple application launcher program built using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). It allows users to add, remove, and launch applications from a list of chosen applications.



## Features
- Add applications: Users can add executable files (.exe) to the list of applications by browsing their file system.
- Remove applications: Users can remove applications from the list.
- Launch applications: Users can launch applications directly from the list by double-clicking on them.
